# CPI Decisions Log

This log tracks every decision made during continuous process improvement cycles — what was shipped, what was deferred, what was rejected, and why. The purpose is to surface patterns across cycles: when a deferred item recurs, we have evidence to ship. When a rejected pattern reappears, we re-evaluate.

## How this works

- Each CPI cycle (`review-runs` analysis OR `sprint-review` run OR ad-hoc reflection) produces findings
- Each finding gets logged here with one of three dispositions: **SHIPPED**, **DEFERRED**, or **REJECTED**
- **DEFERRED** items have explicit **watch-criteria** — what would trigger reconsideration
- **SHIPPED** items have commit references for traceability
- Append-only structure — entries don't get deleted, just amended with status updates when previously-deferred items get shipped (or rejected items get re-evaluated)

## Update cadence

- After every `review-runs` cycle that produces shippable or deferrable findings
- After every `sprint-review` run
- After ad-hoc Reflection feedback that drives decisions

## Why "watch-criteria" matters

Single-occurrence findings are tempting to ship because they're often real. But the engineering-quality rule applies to us too: don't build ahead of evidence. Deferring with explicit watch-criteria means:

1. We don't lose the finding — it's documented here for next-cycle reference
2. We have a clear trigger for reconsideration (recurrence in N more cycles, asymmetric risk class confirmed, etc.)
3. We avoid prompt bloat from ruling-for-everything

The asymmetric exceptions (silent data loss, security incidents, correctness regressions) get noted in the watch-criteria so they're easier to recognize on recurrence.

## 2026-05-03 — `review-runs` cycle (mdc-master-planning + skyy-command)

22 logs total. First post-CPI-cycle-2/3 review with sufficient post-fix data.

### SHIPPED

- **Pattern B — Read-before-Edit hardening** (commit e7c8715)
  - Evidence: cross-review, 29 events total (5 mdc + 24 skyy-command)
  - Replaced soft conditional rule ("if any tool could have rewritten") with hard time-bound rule ("most recent Read MUST be in this turn or immediately previous turn")
  - Applied to all 5 task-execution scripts

- **Pattern D — Bash CWD reset rule** (commit e7c8715)
  - Evidence: 80 events / 9 runs (skyy-command HC-2)
  - New rule: every Bash command starts at worktree root; chain with `&&` or use absolute paths
  - Applied to all 5 task-execution scripts

- **Pattern E — Prefer relative paths inside worktree** (commit e7c8715)
  - Evidence: 27 events / 5 runs (skyy-command HC-1, `.claire/` typo for `.claude/`)
  - New rule encourages relative paths to eliminate long-absolute-path typo class
  - Applied to all 5 task-execution scripts

### DEFERRED — watch-list

- **Pattern A — 25K-token Read overflow**
  - Evidence: persistent across cycles. 14 events / 4 runs (mdc 2026-05-03), 8 events / 3 runs (skyy 2026-05-03), prior cycles also had this pattern
  - Decision: rule already exists, issue is enforcement not text
  - Reasoning: adding more text to existing rule won't change behavior; the right fix is project-side (curated `phase_calico_api_server.md`, `sprint_1_loose_ends.md` known-large-file allowlist in CLAUDE.md). Out of scope for claude-dot-files.
  - **Watch-criteria:** if persists at >2× current rate after project-side allowlist work lands, OR if project-side allowlist proves insufficient → revisit prompt-side reinforcement

- **Pattern C — `find | xargs` whitespace silent data loss**
  - Evidence: 1 event / 1 run (mdc-master-planning)
  - Decision: defer until recurrence
  - Reasoning: single occurrence; per engineering-quality rule, don't build ahead of evidence. Asymmetric (silent data loss class) but consistency with our discipline matters.
  - **Watch-criteria:** ship the `find -print0 | xargs -0` rule on second occurrence in any repo

### Validation signals (no action — confirms prior shipped fixes are working)

- **Parallel review-agent dispatch** is the new norm in 4/5 review-stage runs (H1 from CPI cycle 2-3 paid off)
- **Grep `file_path` parameter mistake** nearly extinct: 8→1 (mdc), 12→4 (skyy)
- **Unbounded re-reads** peak dropped from 17× to 5× in skyy-command

## 2026-05-03 — `sprint-review.sh` run #1 (skyy-command, first ever execution)

Cost: $18.20. Wall time: 11 min. Sprint scope: Sprint 1 — Cluster Provisioning.

**Production value delivered:** caught 2 leaked credential files (one with an n8n encryption key — committed since 2026-04-14, ~3 weeks of exposure), unauthenticated API surface across 26 Django infra views, Django Posture A regression cutting across multiple files, worker chart duplication invisible to per-PR review. Created 46 unit + integration tests. Estimated value: multiples of monthly workflow runtime cost in remediation labor saved.

**Workflow itself:** signal-to-noise excellent (1 noise finding in ~25). Severity calibration well-grounded. Sprint-vs-historical distinction worked correctly. Surface-only mode for refactoring/security findings was respected.

### DEFERRED — watch-list (all single-run evidence; defer per engineering-quality rule)

The first run of any new workflow has the highest rate of friction observations because there's no calibration baseline. We defer all and revisit in run #2 to distinguish first-run noise from real patterns.

- **TS-1 — Components touched explicit in Stage 1**
  - Evidence: 1 occurrence (Post-Run Reflection)
  - Friction: engineer found the phrasing ambiguous about whether to enumerate components or rely on git diff stats
  - Decision: defer
  - Reasoning: one engineer's confusion may be calibration vs systemic. First-run ambiguities are common.
  - **Watch-criteria:** ship clarification if a future sprint-review reflection notes the same ambiguity

- **TS-2 — Surface-only mode boundary case (test conftest fixes)**
  - Evidence: 1 occurrence (Post-Run Reflection)
  - Friction: engineer was unsure whether to fix a `conftest.py` blocking test runs. Chose conservative read (don't modify, document instead).
  - Decision: defer
  - Reasoning: engineer correctly chose conservative read; rule worked as intended. Preemptive clarification is preemptive.
  - **Watch-criteria:** ship clarification if future engineer chooses incorrectly (modifies source-code refactoring under cover of "test tooling fix"), OR if the same boundary ambiguity recurs

- **TS-3 — Deferred-work convention assumption**
  - Evidence: 1 occurrence (Post-Run Reflection)
  - Friction: workflow assumed engineer knew project's loose-ends file conventions (`sprint_X_loose_ends.md` with `2-0a.15`-style identifiers). First-time use against a less-structured repo wouldn't have these handles.
  - Decision: defer
  - Reasoning: pure speculation about future use; we've only run sprint-review on skyy-command which HAS the conventions
  - **Watch-criteria:** ship if sprint-review runs on a repo without loose-ends conventions and engineer can't figure out where to file deferrals

- **WI-1 — Reproduce-claim discipline (highest-priority deferral)**
  - Evidence: 1 occurrence (PM3 evaluation)
  - Friction: 14 integration-test-failures claim couldn't be reproduced via canonical master-runner invocation. Possible false-positive finding made it into the report.
  - Decision: defer (acknowledged tempting because false-positives are asymmetric — they cause unnecessary engineering work)
  - Reasoning: same single-occurrence logic that applied to Pattern C `find | xargs` silent data loss, which we also deferred. Evidence threshold should be consistent.
  - **Watch-criteria:** ship the canonical-runner cross-check rule on second occurrence of unreproducible test-failure findings. Worth flagging for explicit watch in run #2.

- **WI-2 — File-state snapshot timing**
  - Evidence: 1 occurrence (PM3 evaluation)
  - Friction: line counts in report were ~150 lines stale by report-write time (1417 reported vs 1626 actual)
  - Decision: defer
  - Reasoning: could be one-off (Stage 4 modified files between analysis and report) or systemic; can't tell from one run
  - **Watch-criteria:** ship if future runs show similar staleness in file metrics

- **WI-3 — Secret-remediation guidance specificity**
  - Evidence: 1 observation (PM3 evaluation, polish suggestion)
  - Friction: secret-leak findings could include copy-paste-ready `git filter-repo` invocation
  - Decision: defer
  - Reasoning: nice-to-have polish, no failure occurred — engineer surfaced findings correctly, just without operator-convenience commands
  - **Watch-criteria:** ship if operators repeatedly need to look up remediation commands manually across multiple sprint-reviews

### What sprint-review run #1 validates (no action — confirms design)

- Wholistic lens caught issues per-PR review can't (Django Posture A regression, worker chart duplication)
- Sprint-vs-historical distinction works correctly
- Surface-only mode for refactoring/security was respected
- Stage 4 actually delivered tests (46 of them) — not theatrical "we identified gaps"
- Severity calibration is well-grounded
- Cost-benefit overwhelmingly positive on this single run alone

## 2026-05-04 — ad-hoc reflection (global CLAUDE.md structure)

User-initiated reflection during a session about whether the global CLAUDE.md is too coding-specific for an account that may eventually be used for non-coding work (health/wearables analysis, biomedical research, datacenter orchestration, etc.).

### SHIPPED

- **ADRs vs `docs/standards/` clarification** — added a subsection to global CLAUDE.md documenting that this user's convention is "standards documents serve the role of ADRs." AI was occasionally proposing ADR creation when standards docs would accomplish the same goal. Real recurring confusion → ship.
- **Standards Governance — planning-artifacts clause** — extended the Standards Governance section with explicit "planning artifacts (phase docs, roadmaps, loose-ends, sprints) are NOT covered by this rule and engineers MAY edit them." Plus the contradiction-resolution rule (engineer updates phase doc to remove tension, surfaces standards-side amendment as candidate). Captures real friction the user's PM hit.

### DEFERRED — watch-list

- **Global CLAUDE.md restructure for non-coding contexts**
  - Evidence: hypothetical (no non-coding usage yet)
  - Friction: ~70% of global CLAUDE.md is coding-specific (Code Style, Git, Workflow invocation template, Personal Tooling, Standards Governance, CPI Decisions Log, Dependencies & Tools). When non-coding sessions start, all this coding context will load and bias the AI.
  - Decision: defer per engineering-quality rule (don't build for hypothetical future use)
  - Reasoning: current work is 100% coding; restructure now is preemptive. Better to wait until non-coding usage shows real interference, then restructure with concrete data on what's interfering.
  - **Watch-criteria:** ship the restructure when EITHER (a) non-coding Claude work begins and the coding rules cause concrete friction (wrong suggestions, biased framing, off-topic context loading), OR (b) the user explicitly starts new domain work and wants prep work done in advance.
  - **Recommended restructure approach (when triggered):** move coding-specific sections out of global CLAUDE.md into a `software-engineering-context` skill with description "Use when working in any code repository, modifying source code, dispatching autonomous workflows, or doing software engineering tasks." Skills auto-load via description-matching — same lazy-loading the user already gets via per-repo CLAUDE.md references to standards docs, but using the canonical Claude Code primitive.
  - **Alternative (also valid):** router pattern in CLAUDE.md ("for coding load X, for biomedical load Y") — works empirically (the user already uses this in repos) but is less idiomatic than skills. Either approach is fine; skills are slightly preferred.

## How to read this log

**For run #2 prep:** scan DEFERRED sections. Items with `Watch-criteria` met by run #2 evidence become Tier 1 ship candidates. Items still deferred get re-deferred with updated counts.

**For workflow archeology:** SHIPPED items have commit references — `git show <sha>` shows what actually changed.

**For diminishing-returns assessment:** ratio of deferred-then-resurfaced vs deferred-and-never-recurred is the real signal of CPI maturity. High recurrence rate → we're undercalibrating (shipping too few). High never-recurred rate → we're correctly calibrating (deferring noise from one-offs).
